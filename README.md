- Initial project idea: 
I came up with this idea because it seemed like a good way to test my skill in a professional enviornment. The project seemed like it could be applicable to many businesses.

- Tools I used: 
I mainly used Microsoft Excel.

- Challenges I faced:
I faced the challenge of having to learn how to use Excel. I previously had a basic understanding of the program, but this accelerated my skills in an enriching way.

- Other Resources: 
The resources I used was my classmates and my professor.

- Result:
I set out to acheive a monthly loan payment setup for a typical flower shop, that would automatically update when presented with new information. I succesfully did so.

- Summary:
This Excel project tracks a flower shop's inventory levels, manages operational budget allocations, and calculates total monthly expenses including supplies, utilities, loan payments, and a budget to monitor financial performance.

- Initial project idea: 
I came up with this because I wanted to test my coding skill, and was interested in ATMs. 

- Tools I used: 
I used Matlab to complete the project.

- Challenges I faced:
The interface was unfamiliar, and I had to learn it very quickly. While it was similar to Python, it had its own little quirks.

- Other Resources: 
I used informational videos, and asked my professor for assistance.

- Result:
I set out to create a working ATM, and I was succesful. In the future, I'd like to incorporate user authentification.

- Summary:
This MATLAB project simulates a functional ATM system with balance inquiries, cash withdrawals, deposits, and transaction history tracking, demonstrating programming logic and user interface design skills.

- Initial project idea: 
This problem solves finding the intersection point of two linear equations graphically and numerically. It has applications in education and other fields.

- Tools I used: 
I mainly used matlab.

- Challenges I faced:
The hardest part was creating the vectors and calculating Y values since MATLAB syntax is still new to me. I fixed it by testing my code in small steps and checking that the graph showed the intersection point correctly.

- Other Resources: 
I used online resources.

- Result:
I set out to graph two linear equations and find their intersection point, which I successfully achieved by creating the vectors and plotting them in MATLAB. If I could improve this project, I would add features like automatically labeling the intersection coordinates on the graph

- Summary:
This MATLAB project graphs two linear equations to visually identify their intersection point using vector operations, demonstrating fundamental programming skills in creating domains, calculating Y values, and generating plots with proper labeling.
