- Initial project idea: 
I came up with this idea because it seemed like a good way to test my skill in a professional enviornment. The project seemed like it could be applicable to many businesses.

- Tools I used: 
I mainly used Microsoft Excel.

- Challenges I faced:
I faced the challenge of having to learn how to use Excel. I previously had a basic understanding of the program, but this accelerated my skills in an enriching way.

- Other Resources: 
The resources I used was my classmates and my professor.

- Result:
I set out to acheive a monthly loan payment setup for a typical flower shop, that would automatically update when presented with new information. I succesfully did so.

- Initial project idea: 
I came up with this because I wanted to test my coding skill, and was interested in ATMs. 

- Tools I used: 
I used Matlab to complete the project.

- Challenges I faced:
The interface was unfamiliar, and I had to learn it very quickly. While it was similar to Python, it had its own little quirks.

- Other Resources: 
I used informational videos, and asked my professor for assistance.

- Result:
I set out to create a working ATM, and I was succesful. In the future, I'd like to incorporate user authentification.

- Summary:
This MATLAB project simulates a functional ATM system with balance inquiries, cash withdrawals, deposits, and transaction history tracking, demonstrating programming logic and user interface design skills.
